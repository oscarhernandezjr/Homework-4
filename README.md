# Homework 4

In this week's homework assignment, we focus on linked list and their purpose in C#. A linked list is a data structure that holds elements as each of the respective element points to the next element in the sequence. The video begins with explaining that an array has been objectified. With this being said, each node in the list is an object, and the list is also an object which manages these nodes. Before going in depth, we have to understand what a node is, hence being the building block of a linked list. Each node contains data and a reference, to the next node. Now, the node has a head and a tail. The head is the first node in the list. The tail is the last node. 
The video further explains to us the negative aspects of an array. They are fixed, as they cannot be changed in size. We also cannot insert in the middle of an array; promoting the use of linked list. 
Using linked lists are advantageous, due to their memory usage, and ease of insertion and deletion. They are ideal for implementing other data structures where manipulation is needed. It can be beneficial than using arrays as linked lists offers flexibility as well as efficiency when users need to make changes and modifications.
